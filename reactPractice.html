<!-- Load our React component. -->
<!--In production, it is recommended to minify any JavaScript code that is included with your application.
 Minification can help your website load several times faster, especially as the size of your JavaScript source code grows.

Here's one way to set it up:

Install Node.js
Run npm init -y in your project folder (don't skip this step!)
Run npm install uglify-es
Now, to minify a file called like_button.js, run in the terminal:

npx uglifyjs -c -m -o like_button.min.js -- like_button.js
This will produce a file called like_button.min.js with the minified code in the same directory. If you're typing this often,
 you can create an npm script to give this command a name.-->
<script src="js/like_button.js"></script>
